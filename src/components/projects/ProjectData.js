It was created as the final Full-stack project built during my time at the Wild Code School, and it was commissioned by a real clientThe project was designed and developed by three web developers. Dravo is a side product of Beesage, a smart scale used for intelligent beekeeping The MVP set by the client was to allow beekeepers to have a user profile, load and update their information, and then create a leaderboard made of the data collected through the smart scale. Guided by an experienced senior developer, we were able to design ourselves the database, write queries using mySQL, build the whole back-end routing system with Express.js and finally display it to the front-end through React. Every component of the front-end GitHub repository is also fully documented.",

The main goal of the assignment was to learn how to fetch data from an API, and then create a web app using React. The project was fueled by the creativity and endeavour of four web developers, who contributed to every step of development (including sketching up the design and creating wireframes and mockups). What we all agreed on was to create an app that would highlight women's contributions to the advancement of science. Rather than having merely a teaching moment, we wanted to make the experience fun for the user: we then decided to use a gamification approach and to create a memory card game.",
