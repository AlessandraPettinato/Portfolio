				Hey there! This is (again) <span>Alessandra</span>.<br></br>
				<br></br>A few words about me: I was born in a small town in southern
				Italy, but relocated to Rome as soon as I was 18.
				<br></br>
				<br></br>
				Before re-inventing myself as a <span>web developer</span>, when I
				thought that code was just a bunch of random words thrown on a screen, I
				was interested in linguistics, writing, and art -and still am.
				<br></br>
				<br></br>
				The reason why I began dipping my toes into software development mostly
				relies on
				<span> Uncreative Writing</span>, a book by American poet and critic
				Kenneth Goldsmith.
				<br></br>
				<br></br>
				The essay advocates for the intersection of traditional literature with
				programming, while praising those artistic practices which are deemed
				"unoriginal".
				<br></br>
				<br></br>I was so star struck that I had to delve into coding, and thus
				decided to enrol in the <span>Wild Code School</span>'s boot camp at the
				start of 2021.
				<br></br>
				<br></br>
				There, I learnt everything I needed to know regarding how to build web
				and mobile apps using the latest tech stack (
				<span>MySql, Express, React, Node.js</span>) while following the
				<span> SCRUM methodology</span>.<br></br>
				<br></br>
				The boot camp gave me a structure, but it's my passion for
				<span> never-ending learning</span> that drives me through. It is a new
				journey, and a long one, but I'm up for the challenge!
